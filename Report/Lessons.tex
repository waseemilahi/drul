\chapter{Lessons Learned}


\section{Introduction}
In this chapter each team member tells about some lessons he learned from
the project, and what he would do differently if we had start all over
again.

\section{Thierry Bertin-Mahieux}
One part of the code I especially worked on is the test suite, but I still
was surprised to see how important it turned out to be. In a new project,
I would either build a more powerful testing program, or spend more
time to find an appropriate package online. For instance, our current
testing program does not have the ability to test an output file instead
of the standard output. It would have become a problem if our language was
designed for file operations.

Another lesson learned is the importance of helper functions designed early.
At one point, every one of us had design is own method to lookup into the
environment, and obviously we multiplied the number of bugs. For some
functions, it is so obvious that they were going to be needed that we should
have spent the time, as a team, to define them. Their documentation is
also an important aspect when you work in a team of more than two programmers.

Following that idea, we probably did not use enough the ``issue tracking''
on Google code, the platform we used to host our project. Emails does not
work as well...
